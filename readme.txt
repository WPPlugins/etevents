A plugin for WordPress which provides event registration functionality to blog managers who use the Event Theme by Elegant Themes.

== Description ==

ETEvents is a plugin designed to work with the Event theme provided by Elegant Themes. The Event theme lacks any event registration management and relies on third party websites to maintain that information. The ETEvents plugins allows event creators the ability to permit users to register (book), cancel, and reserve entry into an event all without third party websites.

All the instructions for installation, the support forums, a FAQ, etc. can be found on the [plugin home page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/etevents/) or on the [plugin overview page](http://www.bonesnap.com/blog/wordpress-plugins/).

This plugin is available under the GPL license, which means that it's free.
